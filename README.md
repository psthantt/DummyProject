# Project proposal: Maths Question Builder
## A brief overview of the project:
This project will generate a series of question papers and corresponding (possibly well-structured) answer sheets at the level of A-levels Maths and Further Maths. It will serve as a resource that can give a large volume of practice questions for a wide variety of topics, with accurate, verifiable answers.

Users will be able to select specific topics or opt for full syllabus coverage, with each generation being unique and non-repetitive.

A Graphical User Interface (GUI) will allow users to select, modify, and generate question sets.

## Stakeholders:
- Teachers
- Students
- Independent/Homeschooled learners

## Main Project Objectives/Success Criteria:
- **Comprehensive topic coverage.** Each topic will be rigorously classified into subtopics and different styles of questions. These will be implemented as objects, with a central manager combining them into question and answer sheets.
- **Random, unique, and non-repetitive generations.** The numbers, functions and other variables can be logically limited while providing enough randomness and variation.
- **Accurate and verifiable answers.** For each question, the answer generated for it has to be correct, regardless of wording or slight changes.
- **Human-readable and presentable output.** The algorithms will generate objects and/or unformatted outputs, which will then be transformed into readable formats such as image, LaTeX or PDF files.
- **GUI for customisation.** There will be a web-based GUI which works with the generative code to provide as extensive customisation.
### Further considerations
- **A platform for practice.** The users may have an option to practice on a dedicated platform, in which case there will be flexibilities to accept equivalent answer formats (e.g. mixed and improper fractions that are mathematically equivalent).
- **Machine learning.** The system may incorporate machine learning to take on similarly constructed questions and determine a suitable solution method.

## Programming Language(s) and Technology used:
- Python
- Libraries and frameworks for numerical and algebraic manipulation (such as NumPy, SymPy)
- JavaScript
- LaTeX
- APIs (such as Wolfram Mathematica)

## Why this is a suitable project:
The project is a complex but manageable programme which incorporates different aspects of programming, including Object Oriented Programming (OOP), API interaction, GUI, and more. The idea itself is practical and potentially helpful to the described stakeholders. It is also repurposable and, if maintained, could serve as a powerful learning tool.
